# Why does open-source matter so much?

Proprietary, closed-source products:

- do not come with source code
- provide no access to the board's design layout
- do not allow users to easily add the functionality that they want
- do not allow users to modify what they don't like
- generally make it difficult (or impossible) to repair your own product

On the other hand, open-source projects provide:

## Transparency

Most complex hardware projects are closed-source (i.e. black box) and you may only indirectly infer how components are connected or how things operate in general.
Open-source products transparency and freedom to know as much as possible about the products you and others enjoy.
You are able to review and modify open-source software.
You have full access to both the hardware and the software components and you are able to control every bit of your laptop.
You don't even have to purchase anything to access these resources; you can use our work (or parts of it) as a basis for existing projects.

## Freedom To Modify

Open-source hardware allows you and others to tailor the PCBs according to user needs.
For example, you are able to add more processors, memories, etc.

It also gives you independence and self-sufficiency.
If a problem arises (any problem!), you have the freedom to fix it.

We provide the hardware design files and schematics for the TERES-I laptop.
The hardware design is made with an open-source CAD tool called KiCad.

## Peace Of Mind

There is nothing hidden or "fine print" for you to worry about.
No lawyers will chase after you for using this material for personal or commercial use.
(Check the license for further information.)

## Ease Of Use

The sources for the Linux distribution and step-by-step compilation instructions are available and easily accessible.
Documentation can behave as living documents - aggregated reference materials to solve a veriety of uncertainties.

## Education

There is great educational value of open-source products, inherent in the availability of materials to study.

## Support

You don't have to count only on the availability of the technical support.
Don't like the way something works, have an idea for an improvement, or think the documentation sucks?
You can improve it yourself or ask others to help!

## Longevity

Open source gives guarantee for longevity.
Contributors may fork the project, make improvements, and merge those improvements back into the main project to benefit everyone.
There is no concern that a company goes bankrupt and the products disappear.
