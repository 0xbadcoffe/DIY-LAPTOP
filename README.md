## Hardware

All of the hardware schematics and board files are designed using [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org) FOSS software.

> KiCad is free software. KiCad is made available under the GNU General Public License(GPL) version 3 or greater.

All KiCad design files are available within the [HARDWARE](HARDWARE) directory within this repository.

TERES-I is environmentally friendly.
The main board may be upgraded without major revisions to the design, vastly reducing waste and time when new faster and better processors become available.
Spare parts are also available for purchase.
